  quote: When everything seemed lost, when it appeared that your wounds would never
    heal and the scars would only open, she came. "You are brave, but reckless,"
    said the lady in white, who you could only hear and picture. "If you can't put
    her out of harm's way, fret not. I will mend her soul. I will fix her heart.
    Together we will make sure she remains unscathed."
