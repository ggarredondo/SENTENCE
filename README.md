> "I have many separate, distinct and unique ‘parts’ of my personality. My ‘parts’ or ‘alters’ collectively add up to the total person that is me. I am the sum of all my parts. They are each a letter, and I am a sentence." - Carolyn Spring.

SENTENCE is a serious role-playing game about Dissociative Identity Disorder made by a group of four students at Glasgow Caledonian University, for the module Serious Game Design. Its events and gameplay are meant to reflect the development and functioning of the disorder in a metaphorical manner, so that actual DID patients aren't triggered and to encourage players to inform themselves about the topic (as they try to unveil the mystery). We made our best to represent the disorder as faithfully as possible while also keeping the gameplay engaging and interesting.
